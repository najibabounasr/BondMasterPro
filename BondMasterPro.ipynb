    "The program will look to streamline and automate much of the booking process-- with an emphasis on providing accurate calculations for investment bankers. Some utilities could include providing an accurate daily ammortization score, and an accurate zscore. Automation takes ease off human capital requirements for firms such as banks, and allows firms to allocate human resources to other areas. The booking process has ben described to me as a process inherently 'subject to human error' and 'time consuming at the least'."
